# Jabiru API Validation studies

This repository contains a number of validation studies for the Jabiru Cosmic
Ray RESTful API of Amentum Aerospace.

Each directory contains:
1. a Jupyter notebook with calls to the API to generate doses or intensity predictions
2. a YAML file containing published experimental data of doses or intensities
in the atmosphere
3. an image of the comparison between calculation and experiment

Feel free to add your own validation study by:
1. cloning the git repository
2. creating a new directory
3. adding a Jupyter notebook based on an existing one in the repo
4. adding a file containing the digitized spectra in YAML format
5. adding an image to the directory to use as a thumbnail creating a pull
request so we can add the directory to the repository
