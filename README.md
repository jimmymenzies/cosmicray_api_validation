# Jabiru API Validation studies

This repository contains validation studies for the Jabiru Cosmic
Ray API at https://amentum.space

Each directory contains:
1. a Jupyter notebook with calls to the API to calculate cosmic ray doses or intensities
2. a YAML file containing published experimental measurements of doses or intensities, and
3. an image of the comparison between calculation and experiment.

Feel free to add your own validation study:
1. clone the git repository
2. create a new directory
3. create a new Jupyter notebook (using an existing one as a starting point)
4. add a file containing published experimental data in YAML format
5. write Python code that calculates doses or intensities using the API
6. add the resulting image to the repo (to use as a thumbnail on the API landing page), and
7. create a pull request so we can add the directory to the git repository.
