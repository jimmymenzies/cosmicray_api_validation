# Cosmic Ray API Validation studies

This repository contains validation studies for the Cosmic Ray API available at https://amentum.space

Each directory contains: 

- a README.md file containing a description of the study, summary of findings, and instructions to run the Python code and re-generate the results
- if applicable, files containing published experimental data for validation, or data calculated by alternative models for the purpose of benchmarking
- images comparison density or temperature images or profiles obtained using the Cosmic Ray API alongside experimental results of predictions of other models.

Feel free to add validation study by creating a new branch and submitting a pull request.
