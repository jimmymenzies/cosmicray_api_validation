# Background

The CAPRICE (Cosmic AntiParticle Ring Imaging Cherenkov) experiments saw a suite of particle detection instrumentation flown on a balloon from Fort Sumner, USA. The principal goal of the experiment was the detection of cosmic ray anti-particles as evidence of extraordinary sources such as annihilation of dark matter, as well as evidence of conjectured anti-stars. The experiments also provided valuable insights into the composition and intensity of the mixed radiation fields induced by Galactic Cosmic Ray interactions in Earth's atmosphere.

An overview of the apparatus and experiments can be found in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212253) publication and references therein.
