# Background

The CAPRICE (Cosmic AntiParticle Ring Imaging Cherenkov) experiments saw a suite of particle detection instrumentation flown on a balloon from Fort Sumner, USA. The principal goal of the experiment was the detection of cosmic ray anti-particles as evidence of extraordinary sources such as annihilation of dark matter, as well as evidence of conjectured anti-stars. The experiments also provided valuable insights into the composition and intensity of the mixed radiation fields of Earth's atmosphere induced by Galactic Cosmic Ray interactions in the atmosphere.
